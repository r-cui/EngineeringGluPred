# EngineeringGluPred
This is the repository for our study evaluating different engineering settings in data-driven glucose prediction pipeline.

* Prediction scheme: rolling vs. direct
* Prediction target: single-point vs. excursion

We present the core codes for simplicity, one can replicate the work by merging the implementations into [this repository](https://github.com/r-cui/MOTIMGluPred).
